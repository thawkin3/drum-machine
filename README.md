# Drum Machine

This was a project I built for a freeCodeCamp challenge. It's built in React. You can click on the different drum pads to hear the sound each one makes. You can also control it from your keyboard using the letters on the pads. When you play a sound, the name of the sound shows in the box at the bottom.
